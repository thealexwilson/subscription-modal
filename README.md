# Zapier Subscription Upgrade Flow

## Setup
\`\`\`bash
npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`

## Architecture Decisions

**Framework:** Vite + React + TypeScript
- Fast dev experience, modern tooling

**Validation:** React Hook Form + Zod
- Type-safe validation, minimal boilerplate

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- Rapid prototyping, responsive by default

**Testing:** Vitest + React Testing Library
- Fast tests, familiar API

## What I'd Improve With More Time
- [ ] Add proration calculation preview
- [ ] Implement actual payment provider (Stripe Elements)
- [ ] Add loading skeleton states
- [ ] More comprehensive E2E tests
- [ ] Save checkout state to localStorage

## Running Tests
\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`
